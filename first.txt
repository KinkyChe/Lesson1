Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from my position as Web Content Manager.

It has been a pleasure working with you and the team over the last three years. One of the highlights of my career has  been coming to work every morning, knowing I was on the team that started Ghana’s first online retail store, a store that was adjudged e-Commerce company of the year 2014.

Working at Zoobashop has been a truly awesome experience and I’d always be grateful I was given the opportunity to do so. I leave with a shedload of experience. Experience I expect to call upon repeatedly, in future endeavours. Zoobashop is poised for continued growth and I wish you much success in your endeavors.

I would like to help with the transition of my content/social media duties so the company continues to function smoothly after my departure.
